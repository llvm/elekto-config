I first got involved in LLVM as part of an internship working on a JIT for
Python called Unladen Swallow. While this project never took off, it piqued my
interest in LLVM and compilers, and I eventually came back to the project to
work on Windows and Visual C++ compatibility for Clang. This project culminated
in Chrome migrating from MSVC to Clang, which I believe has been hugely
influential as Chromium has become the basis of most major desktop browsers.

Recently, I've served on the LLVM Foundation board of directors. I've
collaborated with Chris Bieneman on the LP0004 governance proposal, and I want
to join the Community Area Team to participate in the first iteration of these
area teams to try to make them work as real decision making entities in our
community. I hope that we can remove roadblocks and expedite decision making
while remaining true to our community's low-process, low-overhead, open source
roots. I believe the scope of the community area team includes drafting and
proposing changes to project-wide policy (subject to project council approval),
and standardizing our community space moderation practices in collaboration with
the existing groups that already do this important work, such as the code of
conduct committee. I can commit the necessary time over the next year to work on
these problems, and would be happy to serve on the area team to help the LLVM
project thrive.
