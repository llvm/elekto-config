I have been participating in the llvm community for seven years, first
as part of the LLDB team and for the past several years as a clang
frontend developer supporting mostly C++. I am currently a clang C++
conformance and Issue Triage maintainer. I am an active clang frontend
code reviewer.

I am also a member of WG21 (The C++ Standards Committee) representing
Intel and I spend much of my time in the Core Working Group where we
often deal with defect reports against the C++ standard.  My role as
both a clang developer and WG21 member means I am often referring or
following up on issues that come up in the community with the Core
Working Group.

As a regular participant in the Clang Frontend Working Group and in
regular discussions with the other active clang frontend developers I
am continuously involved in discussions about the clang community,
development work and issues in the community in general.

I am more widely known in the developer community through my many
years of answering Stackoverflow questions, my weekly C++ quizzes and
semi-regular blog posts on various C++ and clang topics.
