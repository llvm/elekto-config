Gábor Horváth has been an active contributor to the LLVM project for over a
decade, focusing primarily on Clang tooling including the Clang Static Analyzer,
compiler warnings, and Clang Tidy. He is one of the Clang Static Analyzer
maintainers and authored many checks over the years. He also played a key role
in implementing a lifetime analysis (P1179) in a Clang fork and in MSVC. His
contributions include cross translation unit analysis in the Clang Static
Analyzer, new on-by-default lifetime warnings in the compiler and help advancing
the design of a new dataflow analysis framework in Clang. Furthermore, Gábor is
helping to foster new contributors in the open source community, he has mentored
many Google Summer of Code students, and organized panel discussions and gave
talks to help people get up to speed with Clang development. He got passionate
about cultivating the next generation of engineers while doing his PhD in code
analysis at Eötvös Loránd University. Recently, Gábor has led efforts at Apple
to make interoperability of C++ with memory-safe languages like Swift safer.
Outside of LLVM, he has worked on MSVC's code analysis tools at Microsoft.
