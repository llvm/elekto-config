Qiongsi (Jon) recently joined Apple's developer's tools team and he is working
on enhancing the clang modules.

Before joining apple, Jon worked at IBM and contributed to OpenXLC/XLF's
development. Specifically, he worked on enhancing LLVM LTO/PGO capabilities on
IBM's PowerPC/AIX platform. In addition to leading compiler optimization work,
he also worked on Power10 enablement, and led a team to improve IBM's compiler
release infrastructure. He also contributed to enabling Rust support on AIX.

One thing Jon frequently did at IBM was moderating discussions between different
stakeholders and making sure decisions were made and actions were taken on a
timely basis. He would love to continue doing this for the LLVM community.
