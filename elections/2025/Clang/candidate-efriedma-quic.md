I've been an active part of the clang community since clang development started
back in 2008.  I'm one of the maintainers for clang codegen.  I currently work
at Qualcomm improving compilers for various products.

I think the area team will be helpful to improve communication and coordination
between developers, and I'd like to be part of making it work effectively.
