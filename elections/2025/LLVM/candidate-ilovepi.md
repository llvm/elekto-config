I have been an LLVM contributor since 2018 as a graduate student where I used
LLVM to sandbox unsafe portions of Rust programs, and as a full time engineer
since 2021 as part of Fuchsia’s Toolchain team. I’ve worked in several parts of
the project, but have mostly focused on the middle-end (PGO and LTO) and the
RISC-V backend. I am the implementer of MisExpect, StackLayoutAnalysis, and
FatLTO, am one of the maintainers of Clang-Doc, a GSOC mentor for the LLVM
project, and have been a frequent participant in the LLVM developer meeting
program committees.

LLVM has been a fantastic community to be a part of, and I want to help engender
the same spirit of collaboration, thoughtfulness, and engineering excellence
that I’ve benefited from these several years.
