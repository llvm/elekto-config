# LLVM Area Team

This election selects candidates to serve on the LLVM Area Team as defined in
the [LLVM Governance Proposal](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-www/blob/main/proposals/LP0004-project-governance.md).

Area Teams act as the final decision makers for their respective areas of the
project and are responsible for ensuring adequate maintainer coverage and prompt
decision making.

The LLVM Area team is directly responsible for the LLVM core project in the
top-level `llvm` directory.
