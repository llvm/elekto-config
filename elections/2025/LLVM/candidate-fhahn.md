Iâ€™ve been contributing to LLVM since 2016. I am involved in a wide range of
things, from improving vectorization and related analyses to helping LLVM to
better optimize range checks and matrix operations. Time allowing, I am also
working on fixing various bugs in the middle-end and AArch64 backend, as well as
helping with code reviews.
