Matthias has been contributing to MLIR since 2021. His contributions have
primarily been to the core infrastructure (pattern drivers, value bounds
infrastructure, transform dialect, etc.) and to components that are frequently
used in tensor code generation (linalg, memref, SCF, tensor, vector dialects).
He is also the maintainer of the bufferization dialect. He has presented
multiple technical talks / tutorials at the last LLVM Dev conferences.

Matthias is currently a software engineer at NVIDIA, working on an MLIR-based
compiler infrastructure. He has previously worked on the IREE compiler while at
Google.
