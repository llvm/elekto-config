Stephan Herhut joined the LLVM project in 2020 as one of the initial engineers
on MLIR, where he contributed to the design of various dialects and focused on
modeling GPU code generation and structured code generation. Since then, he has
worked on and led multiple projects that use MLIR in production.

While Stephan's current focus lies downstream, he remains dedicated to the
health and continued development of the MLIR compiler infrastructure. His
passion for compilers extends beyond LLVM, spanning languages like JavaScript,
Dart, and machine learning frameworks. He's currently a Distinguished Compiler
Engineer at NVIDIA.
