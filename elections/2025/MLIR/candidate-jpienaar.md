Jacques began contributing to LLVM while working on Lanai backend and, what was
to become, CUDA support in clang. He was one of the founding members of the MLIR
project and has been working on ML compilers and compiler infrastructure at
Google since 2015.

Jacques was one of the original proposers and frequent co-organizer of the MLIR
workshops at the LLVM and EuroLLVM dev meetings. He is currently a TLM in the
generative AI unit at Google working on improving ML model performance across
different architectures and deployment modalities.
