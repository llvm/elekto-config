Alex has been involved with LLVM since 2012, initially working on downstream
adaptations of Clang, Polly and other middle-end optimizers, and then
progressively moving to upstream contributions. Since 2018, he has been a key
member of the team that brought up the MLIR compiler infrastructure, within
Google, then the TensorFlow project, and finally in LLVM. He is a strong
advocate for collaboration between the LLVM community and researchers, both in
industry and academia, promoting usage of LLVM and MLIR through talks and
workshops at major research and professional conferences including CGO, PLDI and
Supercomputing. Alex is a regular presenter at the LLVM developer meetings,
organizer of the MLIR workshop, member of multiple program committees, and
active mentor for anybody interested in contributing to MLIR. He currently holds
a leadership position in a stealth startup company leveraging LLVM and derived
projects to support AI workloads on unconventional hardware.
