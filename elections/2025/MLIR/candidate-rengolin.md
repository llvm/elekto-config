Renato started working on LLVM in 2009 when porting the Arm compiler to LLVM,
then followed to bring the rest of the Arm ecosystem to the rest of the LLVM
ecosystem and eventually becoming one of the Arm code owners. More recently,
he's been trying to do the same thing, but with x86 and MLIR for tensor
compilers (ML/HPC). Renato leads the AI Software Research Group at Intel Labs.
