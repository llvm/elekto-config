# Infrastructure Area Team

This election selects candidates to serve on the Infrastructure Area Team as defined in
the [LLVM Governance Proposal](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-www/blob/main/proposals/LP0004-project-governance.md).

Area Teams act as the final decision makers for their respective areas of the
project and are responsible for ensuring adequate maintainer coverage and prompt
decision making.

The Infrastructure Area team is directly responsible for project infrastructure
such as continuous integration systems, release management, and associated build
and tooling projects.
