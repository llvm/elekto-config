Petr has been contributing to LLVM since 2015. Petr filled in many pieces
necessary to build operating system kernels and other special-case code,
initially as part of enabling a complete LLVM toolchain to build all of Google's
Fuchsia production operating system. This included assembler, linker, and
compiler driver as well as community-leading contributions to the runtimes build
and other build system improvements which were later reused and expanded for
embedded cases.

Petr presented multiple technical talks and tutorials at LLVM Developers'
Meetings over the last several years, and served on the program committee
multiple times, including being a chair for the 2024 LLVM Developers' Meetings.
Petr is also active in the LLVM Embedded Toolchains working group and
co-organized the LLVM Embedded Toolchains workshops.

Petr is the technical lead of the team responsible for LLVM and Rust toolchain
support for Fuchsia and Pigweed projects at Google. Petr also leads the effort
to migrate embedded projects at Google to LLVM toolchain.
