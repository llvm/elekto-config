David Spickett has been contributing to LLVM since 2018, when he joined Arm's
embedded toolchain team. In 2020 he was assigned to Linaro to work on LLDB. In
addition, he leads Linaro's contributions to LLVM's testing infrastructure,
managing a fleet of over 30 different configurations of Clang, Flang, MLIR, LLDB
and Libc++. He spends the rest of his time supporting members of the community
and improving LLVM's contribution and validation processes. For example, by
adding automation to guide new contributors through their first Pull Requests,
and adding succinct, actionable summaries of pre-commit test results.
