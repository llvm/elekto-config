I've been an LLVM project contributor for the last 12 years. I was the
original author of the AMDGPU backend and am currently a Release Manager
and GitHub Admin for the project. I'm also the Technical Lead for the LLVM
Team at Red Hat.

I would like to join the Infrastructure Area Team to help this project
move forward with the infrastructure improvements that are needed to
support our growing community.
