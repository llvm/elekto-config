Anton Korobeynikov began contributing to the LLVM project in 2006.
Over the years, he has made numerous technical contributions to
various areas, including Windows support, ELF features, debug info,
exception handling, and backends such as ARM and x86. He was the
original author of both the MSP430 and SystemZ backends. Recent
notable contributions (besides reviews) include driving the addition
of AArch64 pointer authentication to ELF platforms in the LLVM 19/20
release cycles.

Currently, Anton helps maintain various parts of the LLVM
infrastructure on a daily basis. In the past, he led the migrations
from Bugzilla to GitHub issues and from CVS to Subversion, among
others.

In addition to his technical and infrastructural contributions, Anton
has overseen LLVM’s participation in the Google Summer of Code by
managing applications, deadlines, and overall organization, and he has
served on several program committees for the LLVM Developers’ Meetings
(both in the US and at EuroLLVM).
