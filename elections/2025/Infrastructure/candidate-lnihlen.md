Lucile Nihlen works at Google, where she is one of the leaders responsible for
the production compiler toolchain, as well as the current lead of Google's
internal LLVM advisory body. She has led the recent changes to LLVM's pre-merge
infrastructure, and will continue to work with the LLVM community to coordinate
the investment of Google's resources to maximize benefit for the project. She
gave a talk about her plans at the 2024 LLVM Dev Meeting, and is delivering the
promised system this year.

In her opinion, developer infrastructure is one of the best ways to improve the
inclusivity and sustainability of a project, because newcomers and senior
developers alike all benefit from timely, actionable feedback from automated
sources. If elected to the infrastructure team, her plan will be to finish
delivery of the new infrastructure, and then to coordinate with the community on
refinement and iteration of the new tooling.
