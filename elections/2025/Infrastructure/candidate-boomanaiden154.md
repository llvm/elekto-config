Aiden has been an LLVM contributor since the summer of 2022, primarily focusing
on machine learning guided optimizations (MLGO). Within the realm of machine
learning guided optimizations he has contributed everywhere from register
allocation to benchmarking infrastructure in llvm-exegesis. On top of his MLGO
related contributions, Aiden has also contributed significantly to LLVMâ€™s CI
infrastructure, submitting and reviewing a large number of Github Actions
related patches, fixing minor issues in the existing buildkite-based premerge
system, and is currently helping to bring up a new premerge system that natively
uses Github Actions.
