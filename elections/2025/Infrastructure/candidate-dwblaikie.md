David has been involved in the LLVM project since 2010, initially predominantly
in Clang, then around 2012 focussing on DWARF debug information. David has also
taken an interest in LLVM's Support and ADT libraries, ensuring generic
functionality is well tested and, where relevant, implemented in a way that's
consistent with C++ standard idioms.

David is passionate about code quality and the infrastructure (code review,
tests, frameworks, and automation around those things) that facilitates it,
taking time to pre and post commit patches across the LLVM subprojects with an
eye to test quality.
