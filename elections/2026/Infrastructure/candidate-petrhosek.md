I'm a current member of the Infrastructure Area Team and LLVM Project Council. I have been contributing to LLVM since 2015 and over the years I contributed to nearly every part of the project and worked in a variety of community roles from being the build maintainer to being the PC chair for the LLVM Developers' Meeting and everything between. I filled in many pieces necessary to build operating system kernels and other special-case code, initially as part of enabling a complete LLVM toolchain to build all of Google's Fuchsia production operating system, and more recently a growing number of embedded projects.

The first year of the Project Governance has been [a big learning experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVImySA_e6A) and we made a lot of progress in formalizing various aspects of the LLVM infrastructure such as having a policy for admin roles, establishing budget for infrastructure in collaboration with LLVM Foundation, revisiting LLVM development policy to ensure it matches the reality, etc. There is so much more that needs to be done though and I hope to continue working on issues that affect developer experience with the goal of improving the velocity of all contributors, making the project welcoming to newcomers, and meeting different—sometimes conflicting—requirements of our users.
