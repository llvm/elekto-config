My full name is Jan-Patrick Lehr, though people know me as JP. I currently work at AMD and I maintain most of the AMDGPU buildbots. I have been more or less active in engaging with the upstream community. So far I focused mostly on OpenMP Offloading and its move to the Offloading project.

I see myself as interested in infrastructure and its usefulness to the project but I do not have a strong background in some of the technologies. Of course I am keen to learn what's needed and move things forward.
