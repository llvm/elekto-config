We're still finding our feet with the new governance and at least it feels like especially on the infra area team - identifying, classifying, etc, all the infrastructure pieces is an ongoing process that will benefit from consistency of the folks involved.
Beyond that - I'm especially interested, as before, in moving towards more quantified post-commit review to ensure all changes in LLVM are reviewed in a timely manner without undue burden on the community.
