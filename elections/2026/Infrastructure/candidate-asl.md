Anton Korobeynikov began contributing to the LLVM project in 2006. Over the years, he has made numerous technical contributions to various areas, including Windows support, ELF features, debug info, exception handling, and to backends such as ARM and x86. He was the
original author of both the MSP430 and SystemZ backends. Recent notable contributions (besides reviews) include driving the addition of AArch64 pointer authentication to ELF platforms.

Currently, Anton helps to maintain various parts of the LLVM infrastructure on a daily basis. In the past, he led the migrations from Bugzilla to GitHub issues and from LLVM source code repository CVS to Subversion, among others.

In addition to his technical and infrastructural contributions, Anton has overseen LLVM’s participation in the Google Summer of Code by managing applications, deadlines, and overall organization, and he has served on several program committees for the LLVM Developers’ Meetings (both in the US and at EuroLLVM).

Within Infrastructure Area Team Anton is planning to drive the consolidation of
LLVM infrastructure services into a modern and maintainable system.
