I have been an active MLIR contributor since 2021, working primarily on bufferization, dialect conversion, core MLIR interfaces, and related compiler infrastructure. As a day job, I previously worked on the IREE compiler at Google and currently work on an MLIR-based GPU compiler at NVIDIA. Outside of work, I'd like to help building a strong open-source community around MLIR. I am a frequent presenter at LLVM Developers' Meetings and enjoy collaborating in the open, improving MLIR's code quality, usability, and documentation. MLIR is successful mainly because of the many motivated individuals in the community who invest their own time and drive its development, and I'd like to support that community by contributing my experience as a member of the MLIR area team.
