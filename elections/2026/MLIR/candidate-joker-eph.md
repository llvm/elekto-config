I've been working on MLIR since before it was open-source, and actually drove the contribution of MLIR to the LLVM project. I contributed over 1000 commits to the project, across almost all components, participated in the design of most of the core infra, and authored many RFCs. I also contributed the website, and the initial Toy tutorial.

MLIR is a fairly large and complex project, I care a lot about the consistency of the project and how we can continue to keep modular and preserve its extensibility.
