Jacques has been part of the MLIR project since inception and has been working on ML compilers and compiler infrastructure at Google since 2015. He began contributing to LLVM while working on Lanai backend and, what was to become, CUDA support in clang. He enjoys seeing MLIR keep growing as an open community of compiler engineers across multiple application domains.

Jacques was one of the original proposers and frequent co-organizer of the MLIR workshops at the LLVM and EuroLLVM dev meetings. He was previously a member of the MLIR area team and enjoyed bootstrapping the process. He is currently a TLM in the GenAI unit at Google working on improving ML model performance across different architectures and deployment modalities.
