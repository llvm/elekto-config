Started working on LLVM in 2009 when porting the Arm compiler to LLVM, then followed to bring the rest of the Arm ecosystem to the rest of the LLVM ecosystem and eventually becoming one of the Arm code owners. More recently, similar goals with MLIR for tensor compilers (ML/HPC), including Linalg re-design, CPU/GPU code-gen, Lighthouse project, Tensor Working Group and maintainer of the tensor compiler area of MLIR.
