Gábor Horváth has been an active LLVM contributor for over a decade and is a maintainer of the Clang Static Analyzer. His work focuses on Clang tooling and program analysis, including compiler warnings, Clang-Tidy checks, and lifetime analysis.

He has authored numerous analyzer checks and has led significant efforts in lifetime and memory-safety analysis, including implementing P1179-based lifetime analysis in a Clang fork and MSVC, and advancing a Polonius-inspired lifetime analysis for upstream Clang. He has also contributed to on-by-default lifetime warnings and to the design of Clang’s dataflow analysis framework.

Beyond code, Gábor is deeply committed to the LLVM community: he has mentored multiple Google Summer of Code students, organized panels, and given talks to help onboard new contributors. His passion for cultivating future compiler engineers grew during his PhD in code analysis.

Professionally, he has worked on MSVC code analysis tools at Microsoft and currently leads efforts at Apple to improve C++ interoperability with memory-safe languages like Swift.
