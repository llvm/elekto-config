I began my involvement with the Clang community in 2011 and am currently the lead maintainer of Clang and clang-tools-extra, chair of the 2025 Clang Area Team, chair of the 2025 Project Council, and a member of the community Code of Conduct team. My primary interest in volunteering for the Clang Area Team is to ensure the long-term health of the project so that Clang continues to be a production-quality C and C++ compiler for decades into the future.
