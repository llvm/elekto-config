I'm running for re-election to the clang area team.  I think we've accomplished a lot in the first year, in particular with with our RFC review process.  I'm looking forward to continuing that work this year, and bringing new members into the team (which is expanding from 3 to 5 people).

I'm a compiler engineer at Qualcomm.  In addition to my role on the clang area team, I'm maintainer for clang LLVM IR generation, and active in community development of many other parts of the compiler.
